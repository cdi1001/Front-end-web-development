<p>Ten strangers, who on the surface share little, if anything in common find themselves journeying to a mansion on a secluded island off the coast of Devon. They have been invited there by U.N. Owen. During their first dinner together a gramophone record begins to play betraying each person’s deepest secret. As time progresses they are killed one by one. On an island where nobody is coming or going due to stormy weather, it doesn’t take long for them to work out that the killer must be one of them, so will the innocent survivors find the murderer before it’s too late?</p>

<!--Reasons why it is my favorite book-->
<div>
<center> <h2><i><u>  Why is it my favorite book?</center></h2></i></u> <br>
     
 <center> <p>I was recommended this book by my local librarian four years ago when I told her I was developing an interest in mystery/thrillers. This book helped me delve into the wonderful genre.
 What I love about this book is how unpredictible yet philosiphical the story and plot is and how the story progresses with tension and comes to an unpredictible ending. The story progresses quickly and the suspense quotient keeps hightening. This is the kind of book which will keep you mentally stimulated as your mind will keep working to find the culprit before the author reveals it to you.
I admire how in less than 300 pages Agatha Christie manages to introduce 10 characters, vividly develop them so that they remain distinguished from each other and weave a murder mystery around them. I also admire how the narration style changes along with the point of view whenever the character narrating changes. As the number-one best-selling mystery novel, ever, this is one mystery that has withstood the test of time.  The twists and turns are so intricate, the characters so well-developed, it’s impossible to not feel like you’ve been held “captive” on the island with the guests.
These are the also some of the reasons why the book is known as "The Greatest Mystery Novel of all time". </p></center>
